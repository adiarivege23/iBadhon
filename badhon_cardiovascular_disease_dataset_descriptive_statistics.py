"""#SUMMARY

#This dataset is about cardiovascular disease. The dataset has the information about patients, such as their age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and more. There is no missing data. The patients age range is 20-80.

# Observations: The average resting blood pressure of patients is 131.34.
Around 54% of the patients have heart disease.And 116 patients have 3 diseases.

*italicised text*# Conclusion

Dataset can  use to analyze the factors that contributes to cardiovascular disease and to build model for prediction of the risk of heart disease in patients.
